## Learning objectives:
* Visualize and interpret deforestation events using Sentinel-1 and Alos Palsar data in GEE
* Plot time series data from Sentinel-1 and Alos Palsar and explain changes in forest cover 
* Distinguish how SAR C-band  and L-band see deforestation events 


## Using Google Earth Engine
1. Open the [code editor of GEE](https://code.earthengine.google.com/) 
2. The following figure describes the GEE code editor interface

## Learning objectives:
* Visualize and interpret deforestation events using Sentinel-1 and Alos Palsar data in GEE
* Plot time series data from Sentinel-1 and Alos Palsar and explain changes in forest cover 
* Distinguish how SAR C-band  and L-band see deforestation events 

## Exercise 1: Visualize Time series of Sentinel-1 and Alos Palsar data over a deforestation event
### First let's check how a deforestation event looks with Optical data. We will explore a deforestation event in Papau New Guinea as detected by [RADD Forest Disturbance Alert] (https://nrtwur.users.earthengine.app/view/raddalert). 

### There is availability of [ALOS Palsar ScanSAR] (https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/datasets/catalog/JAXA_ALOS_PALSAR-2_Level2_2_ScanSAR#description) data in GEE over Oceania and South East Asia that we can use together with [Sentinel-1 data] (https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/datasets/catalog/COPERNICUS_S1_GRD).
